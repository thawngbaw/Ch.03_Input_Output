name = input ("What is your name: ")

print("Hello" + name)

# 2. Write a program where a user enters a base and height and you print the area of a triangle.
base = float(input("what is the base: "))
height = float(input(" what is the height: "))

tri = base * height / 2
print(tri)

# 3. Write a line of code that will ask the user for the radius of a circle and then prints the circumference.
radius = float(input("what is the radius of a circle: "))

cir = 2 * 3.14 * radius
print(cir)


# 4. Ask a user for an integer and then print the square root.
number = int(input("type an integer number: "))

# 5. Good Star Wars joke: "May the mass times acceleration be with you!" because F=ma. 
#    Ask the user for mass and acceleration and then print out the Force on one line and "Get it?" on the next.
mass = float(input("what is the mass: "))
speed = float(input("what is the acceleration: "))

sum = mass * speed
print(sum)
print("get it?")
